    "maturity time and maturity paid are floats from 0 to 1 that express how \"done\"\n",
    "a loan is either time-wise, or money wise. There are loan-status adjusted versions as well.\n",
    "I use these because I want to include as much data for my models as possible while recognizing that\n",
    "there is uncertainty in knowing whether a loan was good or bad if it is ongoing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a loan is 120 days late, we know that loan is likely a very bad investment that our model should not be choosing. Is it possible that the loan all of a sudden becomes current and you get a massive return due to accumulated late fees? Yes, but not likely. In any case, I would rather incorporate that likely-to-be-bad loan into the model now instead of wait 2-ish months for that loan to truly go through the charged-off process.\n",

    "maturity_time is how close to original maturity the loan is, regardless of how much the loan has paid back and/or followed the expected payment schedule.\n",

    "\n",
    "status adjusted are adjusting the maturity calculations knowing that if the loan does go the charge-off route, it has x months left or will recover .1 percent of remaining outstanding principal on avg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of loans:\n",
    "1) A loan is issued last month and almost pays off all the outstanding principal this month (maybe a borrower found better loan terms elsewhere, and took out that new loan to almost completely pay down the ) would have maturity_time near 0 and maturity_paid near 1\n",
    "2) A 3 year loan that is 8 months in and is 120 days late has a low maturity_time and fairly high maturity_paid, as there is an adjustment for denominator (aside form what was already paid to date by the loan, only expecting a 10% recovery on remaining outstanding principal)\n",
